# SOOS DAST

The affordable no limit web vulnerability scanner.

Use **SOOS DAST** to:

1. Scan web apps and APIs defined by **OpenAPI**, **SOAP**, or **GraphQL**
2. Containerized solution runs in your environment
3. Manage issues via single-pane web dashboard shared with [SOOS SCA](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/soos-sca-github-action)
4. Track tickets in Jira or GitHub Issues


## How to use it:

You can use the Action as follows:

- Update the `.github/workflow/main.yml`file to include a step like this
``` yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  soos_dast_analysis_example:
    name: SOOS DAST Analysis Example
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run SOOS DAST Analysis
        uses: soos-io/soos-dast-github-action@v1.2.3
        with:
          client_id: ${{ secrets.SOOS_CLIENT_ID }}
          api_key: ${{ secrets.SOOS_API_KEY }}
          project_name: "DAST-GitHub-Action-Test"
          scan_mode: "baseline"
          api_url: "https://api.soos.io/api/"
          target_url: "https://www.example.com/"
```

You can choose between three Jobs:
- [Baseline Analysis](#baseline-analysis)
- [Full Analysis](#full-analysis)
- [API Analysis](#api-analysis)

The `soos-io/soos-dast-github-action` Action has properties which are passed to the action using `with`.

#### Baseline Analysis
It runs the [ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) spider against the specified target for (by default) 1 minute and then waits for the passive scanning to complete before reporting the results.

This means that the script doesn't perform any actual ‘attacks’ and will run for a relatively short period of time (a few minutes at most).

By default, it reports all alerts as WARNings but you can specify a config file which can change any rules to `FAIL` or `IGNORE`.

This mode is intended to be ideal to run in a `CI/CD` environment, even against production sites.

#### Full Analysis
It runs the [ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) spider against the specified target (by default with no time limit) followed by an optional ajax spider scan and then a full active scan before reporting the results.

This means that the script does perform actual ‘attacks’ and can potentially run for a long period of time.

By default, it reports all alerts as WARNings but you can specify a config file which can change any rules to FAIL or IGNORE. The configuration works in a very similar way as the [Baseline Analysis](#baseline-analysis)

#### API Analysis
It is tuned for performing scans against APIs defined by `OpenAPI`, `SOAP`, or `GraphQL` via a URL where the spec file is publicly available.

It imports the definition that you specify and then runs an `Active Scan` against the URLs found. The `Active Scan` is tuned to APIs, so it doesn't bother looking for things like `XSSs`.

It also includes 2 scripts that:
- Raise alerts for any HTTP Server Error response codes
- Raise alerts for any URLs that return content types that are not usually associated with APIs

## Authenticated scans

### Using bearer token

If you need to run a scan against url that needs authorization and the only thing needed is to set an authorization header in the form of `authorization: Bearer token-value` then this is the most straight forward workflow (note that for this method you should have the bearer token value beforehand).

example workflow:

``` yaml
on: [push]
jobs:
  synchronous-analysis-with-blocking-result:
    name: SOOS DAST Scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - name: Run SOOS DAST Baseline Analysis performing bearer token authentication
      uses: soos-io/soos-dast-github-action@v1.2.0
      with:
        client_id: ${{ secrets.SOOS_CLIENT_ID }}
        api_key: ${{ secrets.SOOS_API_KEY }}
        project_name: "DAST-bearer-token"
        scan_mode: "baseline"
        bearer_token: "token-value"
        api_url: "https://api.soos.io/api/"
        target_url: "https://www.example.com/"
```

### Authenticate throughout a login form and get the auth token.

Using this option there will be an automated login form authentication performed before running the DAST scan to get the bearer token that will be then added to every request as the authorization header.

This is how a example workflow will look like:

``` yaml

on: [push]

jobs:
  synchronous-analysis-with-blocking-result:
    name: SOOS DAST Scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - name: Run SOOS DAST Baseline Analysis performing form authentication
      uses: soos-io/soos-dast-github-action@v1.2.0
      with:
        client_id: ${{ secrets.SOOS_CLIENT_ID }}
        api_key: ${{ secrets.SOOS_API_KEY }}
        project_name: "DAST-login-form"
        scan_mode: "baseline"
        api_url: "https://api.soos.io/api/"
        target_url: "https://example.com/"
        auth_login_url: "https://example.com/login"
        auth_username: "username-to-fill-field"
        auth_password: "password-to-fill-field"
        auth_username_field: "username-html-input-id"
        auth_password_field: "password-html-input-id"
        auth_submit_field: "submit-html-input-id"

```

### Authenticate against an OAuth token url.

In case you need to perform a DAST analysis against an OAuth application this is the workflow that you should follow. In this scenario the DAST tool will perform a request to get the `access_token` before doing any analysis.

Workflow example:

``` yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  synchronous-analysis-with-blocking-result:
    name: SOOS DAST Scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - name: Run SOOS DAST Baseline Analysis performing OAuth
      uses: soos-io/soos-dast-github-action@v1.2.0
      with:
        client_id: ${{ secrets.SOOS_CLIENT_ID }}
        api_key: ${{ secrets.SOOS_API_KEY }}
        project_name: "DAST-OAuth"
        scan_mode: "baseline"
        api_url: "https://api.soos.io/api/"
        target_url: "https://example.com/"
        oauth_token_url: "https://example.com/token"
        oauth_parameters: "client_secret:value ,client_id:value , grant_type:value"
```
